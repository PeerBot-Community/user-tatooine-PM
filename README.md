# 🏜️ Tatooine Stays

A static Airbnb clone for the galaxy's most famous desert planet. Because even moisture farmers need vacation rentals.

## What This Is

A single-page application showcasing accommodations on Tatooine - from luxury domes to cantina lofts. Features property filtering, detailed listings, and enough Star Wars references to make a Jedi cringe.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Serve locally (because file:// protocol is as outdated as the Empire)
python -m http.server 8000

# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## Features

- 📱 **Mobile-first responsive design** - Works on everything from holopads to protocol droids
- 🔍 **Real-time filtering** - Find your perfect hideout from Imperial forces
- 🏠 **Property details modal** - View amenities like "Jawa-Proof Locks" and "Sand-Free Zones"
- 🌅 **Twin sunset views** - Because one sun is never enough

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks, just like the Rebels like it)
- **Data**: JSON files (because even Tatooine doesn't need a database)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages ready (as reliable as a moisture vaporator)

## File Structure

```

## Why Tatooine?

Because if Luke Skywalker can find hope in this desert wasteland, surely tourists can find a decent vacation rental.

*May the stays be with you.* ⭐
